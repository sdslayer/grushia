      <h1 class="white">The Grushian Independence Revolution</h1>
      <p>The <b>Grushian Independence Revolution</b> was a war fought from 1935 to 1937, between the Grushian Rebellion and the forces of Oceania. On April 12, 1835, the noble class citizens of the Grushian Territory controlled by Australia at the time, drafted their own Declaration of Independence. Australian government officials did not respond to this lightly, and ultimately just brushed it off and maintained their presence. On April 14, 1835, the Grushian military rebelled against all Australian officials present in the country, and kickstarted the war.</p>
	  <p>Supporting the Australians were all surrounding nations of Oceania, as well as financial support from Sweden and Japan. Whilst the Grushians were supported financially by Canada, France, Spain, and given military support from the United States.</p>
	  <p>The war ended on June 9, 1937 when the Australians signed the <b>Treaty of Grush</b> and accepted defeat, acknowledging Grushian independence.</p>
	  <p>Soon after the war ended, Grushia organized two distinct counties to control separate parts of the new nation, Cadrega County and Guy County. The capital was set in the newly founded Cadrega City, named for Fort Cadrega, located in the same region, where most battle operations had been centered.</p>
